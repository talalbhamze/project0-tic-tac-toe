# Project 0: Tic Tac Toe

### By Talal Hamzeh 

## Game Instructions

- Tic Tac Toe is a two player game, playerO and playerX. PlayerX always goes first.

- The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three 'o' or 'x' in a row on the 3x3 grid.

- Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the grid by clicking the square until either (a) one player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally; or (b) all nine squares are filled.

- If a player is able to place three Xs or three Os in a row, that player wins and the game is over.

- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, there is no winner and the grid is cleared for a new game.
